                In this project I have created a password generator to create strong and secure passwords. In this generator a user goes through a series of prompts with various questions at the top of their screen. When the user arrives to the website they must click on the "generate password" button in red. The user will be asked to enter a numerical value for the length of the password on a range from 8 to 128 characters long. If the password length is a number less or more than the parameter then the user will be promted to try again. Then the user will be asked to click whether or not they would like a password to include at least one character type from special characters, lower case and upper case letters. The user must select from at least one of these characters, none are selected then they will receive a new promt asking that they choose at least one character type. After the user goes through all the prompts a password will be automatially generated using the criteria the user chose.
